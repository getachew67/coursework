<li>
Implement the alphabetic sums problem
<blockquote>
<pre>
Alphabetic sums:
puzzles that give a sum of two numbers, but with the digits  replaced by letters,
frequently appear in papers and magazines. Different letters in these puzzles
are meant to denote different digits. For example:

  CROSS
+ ROADS
  -----
 DANGER

</li>
<li>
Write a match predicate that determines if the first argument (a pattern of some
kind) matches the second argument (a list to be checked against). So:
<blockquote>
<pre>
math[X,a,Y], [here, is, a, duck])
X = [here, is]
Y = [duck]
</pre>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
