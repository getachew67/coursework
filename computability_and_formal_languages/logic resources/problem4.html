<li>
Finish the expert system shell we went over in class. In particular (!) put in
a rulebase that represents an area in which you have some expertise in order
to understand the kinds of judgments these backward chaining, rule-based expert systems can produce. (The lecture notes are available in the lectures directory under expert.pdf.) I'll make the code available Mar 2.
