Parser
* Make sure that braces denoting a block without a loop/conditional works

Type Transformer
* Make sure the boolean operators && and || work inside loops and conditionals
* Make sure INT_NEG and FLOAT_NEG work
* Make sure adding two characters works (optional?)
* Make sure there are exceptions for bool+int, float+char, and others
* Make sure that int = int + float creates a type error (if you are only doing widening)
* (related to above) If you're doing implicit casting, make sure typeOf is returning what it should

Semantics
* Make sure the operators on boolean values work
