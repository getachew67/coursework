$ Project Euler, problem 21
$ 
$ Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less
$ than n which divide evenly into n).
$ 
$ If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable
$ pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.
$ 
$ For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20,
$ 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284
$ are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.
$ 
$ Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

program pe21;
as := amicables(10000);
sum := 0 +/ as;
print(sum);

proc properdivisors(n);
     return {x in [1..n div 2] | n mod x = 0};
end proc;


$ This is the function described in the statement of the problem
proc d(n); 
     return 0 +/properdivisors(n);
end proc;

$ Return the set of all amicable pairs under n
proc amicables(n); 
     return {a+b : a in [1..n], b in [d(a)] | a > b and d(b) = a}; 
end proc;   

$ naive solution:
$ return {a,b : a in [1..n], b in [1..n] | a /= b and d(a) = b and d(b) = a};

end program;
