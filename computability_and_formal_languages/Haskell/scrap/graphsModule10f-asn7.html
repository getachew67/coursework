<h2>Graph module using Set-of-edges representation
  </h2>
</center>

Build a GraphSE.hs module that implements a Graph Abstract Data type using
a Set-of-edges internal representation. Here's a type definition to get
you started. This represents as a pair of a vertex set and and edge set.
Assume that you will use this representation to implement both directed
graphs (di-graphs) and un-directed graphs (graphs). 
<p>
> newtype Graph a = Graph (Set a, Set (a,a))
<p>
Altogether your will build a Set module (the first part
of this assignment), a Graph module using the
Set module (this part of the assignment),
and a top level GraphAlgsSimple.lhs module or script with some graph
functions. This part of the lab is to construct just the Graph module.
<p>
If you want, you can start with the
<a href="GraphSE-skel.lhs">GraphSE-skel.lhs skeleton</a>,
a modified version of the Graph module skeleton given in class. (It is pretty
rough at the moment.)
<p>
Be sure to test your GraphSE module using at least the tests given in the
skeleton file.
