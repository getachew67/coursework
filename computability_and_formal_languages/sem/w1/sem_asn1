Quesions to answer about the "What to Know about Typing" paper.

What is the principle thesis of this paper?
Framing the type system debate in terms of the upper and lower bound programs
that are defined by static and dynamic type checking. 

What is a type?
A type is a domain labeling that is used by the type system to prove some
property of the program's behavior.

What is a static type?
A static type is a type that is determined and known before the program is
executed.

What is a dynamic Type?
A dynamic type is a type that is determined and known after the execution of
the program has begun.

What is testing in relation to typing?
Dynamic typing systems emphasize testing because they have no way of formally
proving program correctness before the program is run, so the best that can be
done is thorough testing.

What are proofs of correctness in relation to types?
Static typing allows us to check the type correctness of a program before it is
ever run, which is effectively a proof of the program's correctness in regard
to its types

What does he mean by "upper bound"? "Lower bound"?
It could be said to refer to the same concept found in the diagram at the
beginning of the schwartzbach paper.

What does "Sound type system" mean?
Soundness in a type system means that every possible proof in the system has a
correspondence into semantics.

What does "type safe" mean?
Type safety means that the only operations that we can perform on some data are
the operations sanctioned by that data.

what kind of properties can I only use dynamic typing
Reflection, metaprogramming, dynamic message dispatch, mock objects, rapid
prototyping
