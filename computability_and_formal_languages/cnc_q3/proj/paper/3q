\begin{abstract}
    This paper provides an introductory tutorial to three contrasting and
    unusual programming languages: Smalltalk, SETL, and Agda. Some prior
    experience in programming is assumed. The languages are highly abstract yet
    represent very different perspectives: the object oriented paradigm,
    functional programming with dependent types, and set-based imperative
    programming. Working with each of them at the same will be an invigorating
    brain exercise and will hopefully provide some unique insights into the
    strengths and weaknesses of each style.

\section{Introduction}
    Agda represents the extreme end of functional type theory based on the
    elegant syntax of Haskell. The language will introduce the very
    interesting world of dependent types and all the expressiveness that comes
    with them. Smalltalk is a much older language known for its pure
    implementation of the object oriented type system, made famous by such
    extremely popular languages as C++ and Java. Finally, SETL is the oldest of 
    the three languages whose main feature is its flexible, built-in support 
    for creating and manipulating sets and tuples.

    We will start out with a quick overview of the syntax of each language,
    starting with the least difficult, SETL, and progressing to the most
    difficult, Agda. This paper will emphasize a discussion of the typing
    model of each language.

    We will then examine three programs chosen to showcase the advantages of
    each of the languages. We will follow this with a larger, single program
    written in all three languages to provide a direct, contrasting example
    among all three styles.  The larger program, a top down parser, was chosen
    in the hope that none of the three paradigms would have a very big
    advantage in its implementation over the others.
