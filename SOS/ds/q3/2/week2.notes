Week 2 was passover and only had meetings with sherri.

She suggested the following method for cpp OO printing:

void output(ostream& out) const {
	out << "JobRqst(" << name << "," << numTcks << "," << numProcessors << ")" ;
}

ostream& operator<<(ostream& out, const JobRqst& x) {x.output(out); return out;}

She also suggested that I do the quicksort testing project on the SLACR cluster.
