ABOUT
I used my list data structure, which I've used for several assignments already,
found in 'list.h.' A traversed/sorted directory is simply a list of strings.

All the pertinent code is in 'traverse.cpp'. I tried to make things real
generic so have some function and data structure passing going on. I used
'dirent' from the C libs to open and read directories.

I made very minimal queue and stack data structures with only push/pop and
'list.h' as the backend. These are used for the traversal.

I used merge sort since it's all linked lists. I wrote a pretty basic
version of merge sort so it's probably not very optimized. I have merge sort
take a function as a parameter so that we can use the same code to sort both by
size and by modification time.
