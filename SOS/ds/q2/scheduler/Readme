COMPILE & RUN:
compile with: $ make
run with:     $ ./jobsched

Inside the program, enter 'help' to get the commands.

OTHER USAGE:
None yet.

NOTES ON THE MAKEFILE:
I probably should have put the implementations inside the .h files for
processor.cpp and process.cpp, but I liked to keep them very separated. The
downside of this file separation is that you have to list these extra .cpp
files when you compile with g++.
