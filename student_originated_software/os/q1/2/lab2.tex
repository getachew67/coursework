\begin{enumerate}

 \item[\textbf{1.}]
  I used Debian's "aptitude install" and it went flawlessly.
 
 \item[\textbf{2.}]
  Downloaded the suggested slackware image to my
  own personal netbook which I'll use to do these
  labs.

 \item[\textbf{3.}]
  Creation of the virtual machine using the vdi as a
  virtual hard drive went without hiccups.
  
 \item[\textbf{4.}]
  Logging in and logging out of everything worked dandily.

 \item[\textbf{5.}]
  I added a user called 'jb' using Slackware's easy adduser script located at
  '/usr/sbin/useradd'

 \item[\textbf{6.}]
  Did a scp from ada to my VM and copied my lab1.c file. I compiled and ran it
  and it worked as expected. I brewed a cup of tea in celebration.
  
 \item[\textbf{6/7.}]
  I installed openssh-server on my netbook. On the first try ssh did not work.
  SSH to ada works fine but not to the host machine. I only get networking by
  using NAT. Bridging doesn't work. I can ssh to and from my host machine's IP.
