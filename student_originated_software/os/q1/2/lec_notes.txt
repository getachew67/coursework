Process is the resource context, thread is the execution context.

Concurrence: interleaving of execution, pseudo-parallel

The dividing line between a VM and the VM monitor is the ABI?
The dividing line between a VM and its applications is the API?


System VM -- between OS and hardware

Symmetric multiprocessing has a processor queue. The scheduler runs on one of
the processors that it is scheduling? Must be careful to synchronize resource
usage for shared memory and io.

Three levels of multicore parallelism
  instruction level
  threads within processor
  concurrency

Grand Central Dispatch in OSX 10.6 gives programmer control of parallelism.

Kernel has privelaged instructions, eg scheduling, that the users do not access.
