Heap Sort

Heap Property:

A[Parent(i)] >= A[i] for all nodes i > 1
Largest node is thust the root (A[1])

heapsort(ls):             [n times]
  remove & write out max  [lg(n)]
	heapsort(ls)            [1]

thus:
n * lg(n)


Closed form of powers of 2:
sum(i=0, x, 2^i) = 2^(x+1) - 1

generalized
sum(i=0, x, r^i) = (r^(x+1) - 1) / r - 1
