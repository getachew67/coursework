# Model Representation
Recall that in *regression problems*, we are taking input variables and trying to predict the output onto a *continuous* expected result function. 

Linear regression with one variable is also known as "univariate linear regression."

Univariate linear regression is used when you want to predict a **single output** value from a **single input** value. We're doing **supervised learning** here, so that means we already have an idea what the input/output cause and effect should be. 

# The Hypothesis Function

Our hypothesis function has the general form:
$$h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x$$

We give to $$h_\theta$$ values for $$\theta_0$$ and $$\theta_1$$ to get our output 'y.' In other words, we are trying to create a function called $$h_\theta$$ that is able to reliably map our input data (the x's) to our output data (the y's).

Example:

<table><tr><th>x (input)</th><th>y (output)</th></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>7</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>7</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>8</td></tr>
</table>

Now we can make a random guess about our $$h_\theta$$ function: $$\theta_0 = 2$$ and $$\theta_1 = 2$$. The hypothesis function becomes $$h_\theta(x) = 2 + 2 x$$. 

So for input of 1 to our hypothesis, y will be 4. This is off by 3.

# Cost Function
We can measure the accuracy of our hypothesis function by using a **cost function**. This takes an average (actually a fancier version of an average) of all the results of the hypothesis with inputs from x's compared to the actual output y's. 

$$J(\theta_0, \theta_1) = \dfrac {1}{2m} \displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^m \left (h_\theta (x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \right)^2$$

You don't have to worry about the details about why this equation works; just think of it as taking the average of the differences of all the results of our hypothesis and the actual correct results.

Now we are able to concretely measure the accuracy of our predictor function against the correct results we have so that we can predict new results we don't have.

# Gradient Descent

So we have our hypothesis function and we have a way of measuring how accurate it is. Now what we need is a way to automatically improve our hypothesis function. That's where gradient descent comes in.

Imagine that we graph our hypothesis function based on its fields $$\theta_0$$ and $$\theta_0$$. This can be kind of confusing; we are moving up to a higher level of abstraction. We are not graphing x and y itself, but the guesses of our hypothesis function. 

We put $$\theta_0$$ on the x axis and $$\theta_1$$ on the z axis, with the cost function on the vertical y axis. The points on our graph will be the result of the **cost function** using our hypothesis with those specific theta parameters.

We will know that we have succeeded when our cost function is at the very bottom of the pits in our graph and our result is 0 (or close to it). 

The way we do this is by taking the **derivative** (the line tangent to a function) of our cost function. The slope of the derivative will give us a direction to move towards. We make steps down that derivative by a constant value called alpha.

The gradient descent equation is:

$$ \text{repeat until convergence:} $$

$$ \theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{\delta}{\delta \Theta_j} J(\theta_0, \theta_1)$$

Intuitively, this could be thought of as:

$$\text{repeat until convergence:}$$

$$ \theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \[\text{Slope of derivative}\]$$

# Gradient Descent for Linear Regression

When specifically applied to the case of linear regression, a new form of the gradient descent equation can be derived. We can substitute our actual cost function and our actual hypothesis function and modify the equation to:

$$\text{repeat until convergence:}$$

$$\theta_0 := \theta_0 - \alpha \frac{1}{m} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m}h_\theta(x^{(i)} - y^{(i)}) $$

$$ \theta_1 := \theta_1 - \alpha \frac{1}{m} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m}h_\theta(x^{(i)} - y^{(i)}) * x^{(i)}$$

Note that we have separated out the two cases for $$\theta_j$$ and that for $$\theta_1$$ we are multiplying $$x^{(i)}$$ at the end.

The point of all this is that if we start with a guess for our hypothesis and then repeatedly 
 apply these gradient descent equations, our hypothesis will become more and more accurate.

# What's Next

Instead of using linear regression on just one input variable, we'll generalize and expand our concepts so that we can predict data with multiple input variables.
