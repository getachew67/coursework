Haskell Programming Final Exam<br>
March 11, 2010</h3>
<p>
This exam is open book, open note. You may use a computer
to look at syllabus notes or previous assignments, 
or even Hugs if you wish. (But don't get too caught up
in trying to write a perfect program: it will just waste time.)
Collaboration of any kind is not allowed. <b>Please submit
your answers </b> as a literate haskell file, with any text responses
included..
</p>
<ol>
<li>
(25 points total)<br> The use of <b>where</b> to avoid recomputation
and improve readability is strongly encouraged in both parts of this
question (and where appropriate in other questions).<br>
(a) (15 points) Write a function <b>partition</b> that splits a list
of Int into two lists, one containing elements of the original list
that are greater than a partitioning value (which is an Int), the
other containing all elements that are less than or equal to the
partitioning value. <b>Do not use list comprehension in your
function!</b>
<br>
(b) (10 points) Qsort is a sorting function that can be described
as follows:
<ul>
<li> If the list is empty it is sorted.
</li><li> If the list is non-empty, use the first element of the list
as a pivot and partition the list into two lists: elements less than
the pivot in one list,
and elements greater than the pivot in the other list.
</li><li> perform quicksort on each list.
</li><li> Construct the sorted list by appending the results of the previous step,
including the pivot in the middle.
</li></ul>
There is an implementation of quicksort in the textbook on p 127:
<pre>
&gt;	qSort [] = []
&gt;	qSort (x:xs) = qSort [y | y&lt;-xs, y&lt;=x] ++ [x] ++ [y | y&lt;-xs, y&gt;x]

</pre>
Write a new <b>qSort</b> that <b>does not use list comprehension.</b>
</li>
<li> (25 points total)<br>
(a) (10 points) Use <b>foldr</b> to define a function <b>unZip4</b> that
unzips a list of four-tuples into a four-tuple of lists. Use the most
general type definition possible for your function.
Use the definition of <b>unzip3</b> from the prelude as a model:
<pre>
&gt;	unzip3'   =  foldr (\(a,b,c) (as,bs,cs) -&gt; (a:as,b:bs,c:cs))
&gt;                  ([],[],[])

</pre>
(b) (10 points) Define the same function using recursion and pattern matching.
<b>Do not use list functions other than :</b> in your definition
<br>
(c) (5 points) Can the function be defined using <b>foldr1</b>?<br>
Why or why not?
</li>
<li>
(25 points total) All parts of this question refer to the following
Haskell code.  The code is all in the same file.
<hr>
<pre>
&gt;	p :: (Int -&gt; [Int] -&gt; [Int]) -&gt; [Int] -&gt; [Int]
&gt;	p f [] = []
&gt;	p f (x:xs) = f x (p f xs)
&gt;	
&gt;	f :: Int -&gt; [Int] -&gt; [Int]
&gt;	f x [] = [x]
&gt;	f x (y:ys)
&gt;	  | x &gt; y = x:(y:ys)
&gt;	  | otherwise = y : f x ys
&gt;	
&gt;	g :: Int -&gt; [Int] -&gt; [Int]
&gt;	g x [] = [x]
&gt;	g x (y:ys)
&gt;	  | x == y = (y:ys)
&gt;	  | x &lt; y = x:(y:ys)
&gt;	  | otherwise = y : g x ys

</pre>
<hr>
In the following calculations, be very careful to show all steps. Your result
should proceed one evaluation step at a time. You should show how patterns
are matched, and clearly show replacement of parameters by the arguments.
You should show evaluation of each guard in order. See page 341 for an
example of how guards and pattern matching should be hand calculated.<br>
<br>
(a) (10 points) Show a line by line calculation of
<pre>p f [5,2,-3,2]</pre>
(b) (10 points) Show a line by line calculation of
<pre>p g [5,2,-3,2]</pre>
(c) (5 points) Use <b>foldr</b> to redefine p.
</li>
<li>(25 points total) Redefine each of the following functions <b>without
using list comprehension.</b> Instead, use <b>map</b> or <b>filter</b> (or
both). For each function, give a type definition that is as general as
possible. Assume all numbers are of type <b>Int</b>.<br>
<br>
(a) (5 points)
<pre>
&gt;	f1 ns = [x | x&lt;-ns, x &gt; 5]

</pre>
(b) (5 points)
<pre>
&gt;	f2 ns = [x++x | x&lt;-ns ]

</pre>
(c) (5 points)
<pre>
&gt;	f3 ns = [x*10 - x*x | x&lt;-ns, x &gt; 5, x &lt;= 24]

</pre>
(d) (5 points)
<pre>
&gt;	f4 ns = [x&lt;20 | x&lt;-ns, x &gt; 5]

</pre>
(e) (5 points)
<pre>
&gt;	f5 [] = []
&gt;	f5 (n:ns) = [x | x&lt;-ns, x/=n]

</pre>
